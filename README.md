# GoLang Project with GitHub Actions Pipeline

This is a simple GoLang project demonstrating the use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI).

## Use Case

The use case of this project is to showcase how to set up a CI pipeline for a GoLang project using GitHub Actions. With this setup, you can automatically run tests on every push to your repository's main branch or when a pull request is opened against it. This helps ensure that your codebase remains stable and any new changes are thoroughly tested before merging into the main branch.

## What Else Can Be Done?

Beyond the basic setup demonstrated in this project, you can extend the GitHub Actions pipeline to include additional steps such as:

- Building and packaging your Go application into binaries
- Running static code analysis tools (e.g., GoLint, GoVet)
- Performing code coverage analysis
- Integrating with other services for deployment (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS, Heroku)
- Setting up scheduled jobs for tasks like dependency updates or database migrations

Feel free to explore and customize the GitHub Actions workflow to fit the specific needs of your project. The possibilities are endless!
